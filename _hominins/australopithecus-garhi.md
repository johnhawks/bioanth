## Discovery

On November 20, 1997, Yohannes Haile-Selassie found several fragments of a skull while prospecting for fossils in the Middle Awash paleoanthropological study area. At the time, Haile-Selassie was a part of the team led by American anthropologist Tim White. The Middle Awash field site is a very large area, and the team had earlier designated the particular location where Haile-Selassie found the skull as <strong>Bouri</strong> Vertebrate Paleontological locality 12 (BOU-VP-12). The fragmentary skull received the number BOU-VP-12/130. 

In 1999, the team described the skull, in a paper led by Ethiopian researcher Berhane Asfaw. They concluded that the skull did not fit into any other species known at the time. For this reason, the team defined a new species, <em>Australopithecus garhi</em>. The name <em>garhi</em> means "surprise" in the Afar language.

## Date and context


## Anatomy

The preserved portions of the skull are similar in size and shape to australopith skulls, such as Sts 5 from Sterkfontein, South Africa. Only a few portions of the vault remain, and these suggest a volume of around 450 ml. The skull preserves the alveolar portion of the maxillary bones, as well as most of the maxillary teeth. Like both <em>Australopithecus afarensis</em> and <em>Australopithecus africanus</em> skulls, the rows of premolars and molars are long and relatively straight. Also like these species, the upper jaw projects forward beneath the nasal aperture, a condition known as <strong>subnasal prognathism</strong>. 

The molar and premolar teeth are very large compared to the teeth of <em>Au. africanus</em> or <em>Au. afarensis</em>. They resemble the large molar and premolar teeth of the robust <em>Paranthropus</em> species. Yet the large premolars of BOU-VP-12/130 are shorter than the elongated premolars of <em>P. boisei</em>. The skull also has much larger canine teeth than either <em>P. boisei</em> or <em>P. robustus</em>. 

The hominids from Bouri, a site in the Middle Awash valley near the earlier sites of Aramis and Maka, date to about 2.5 million years ago (Asfaw et al. 1999). The site is the earliest to combine an archaeological assemblage, including evidence for hominid modification of faunal remains, with the fossil remains of hominids themselves. The preserved hominids may or may not be the toolmakers, but the archaeological evidence is highly significant for understanding the changing hominid ecology. The remains make it clear that Late Pliocene hominids had begun to consume a significant amount of meat, and raises the question of a relationship between the Bouri hominids and later *Homo*. 

## Phylogenetic position

The skull is larger in tooth size and enamel thickness compared to earlier Hadar remains, accompanied by a slight decrease in anterior tooth size and a divergent posterior tooth row. 

The skull does not show the characteristic anatomy of contemporary South African remains, for example it lacks anterior pillars, and possesses a slight sagittal crest. 

The postcanine teeth are quite large, with the premolars larger than any specimen of <em>A. africanus</em> or <em>A. afarensis</em>. Yet these large premolars do not have the molar-like elongation of later robust australopithecines. 

At the same time, the anterior teeth are substantially larger than any robust australopithecine. The canines are larger than most specimens of <em>A. africanus</em> or <em>A. afarensis</em>.

Despite its tooth size, the skull does not have the degree of robusticity present in KNM-WT 17000, presumed to be \species{A. aethiopicus}, while it has a considerably larger brain, at 450 \cc.
\end{enumerate}

Other species also have these features, but no single species has all of them. This makes it hard to figure out exactly what other species this specimen is related to. One possibility is that \species{A. garhi} is closely related to later \species{Homo}. 

## Debates

A second hypothesis that seems less likely is that the BOU-VP 12/130 skull represents a geographic variant of South African \species{A. africanus}. The proportions of the teeth of this specimen are similar to those found in South African \species{A. africanus}, though the breadth of the upper canine and $P_3$ are larger than the South African extremes. The major differences between the samples are the skull's lack of anterior pillars, presence of a sagittal crest, and relatively small brain size for a male invididual. It is conceivable that these represent geographic differences or temporal differences within a single species.
